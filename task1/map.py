# Map Class
# @Author: Cesar A. Tacla, UTFPR
#
## A map representing the explored region of the 2D grid
## The map is a dictionaire whose keys are pairs (x, y).
## The map contains only visited positions.
##
## Associated to each key, there are:
## - the degree of difficulty to access the cell
## - the victim seq number (if there is one) or VS.NO_VICTIM if there is no victim
## - the known actions' results from the cell represented as vector of 8 integers, in the following
##   order: [up, up-right, right, down-right, down, down-left, left, up-left]. Each position may
##   have the following values:
##   VS.UNK  the agent ignores if it is possible to go towards the direction (useful if you want
##           to not use the check_walls_and_lim method of the AbstAgent and save only tried actions)
##   VS.WALL the agent cannot execute the action (there is a wall),
##   VS.END  the agent cannot execute the action (end of grid)
##   VS.CLEAR the agent can execute the action
